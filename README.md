# 3D Character Animation Workflow:
This 3D animation marks my initial attempt. As a beginner in the field of 3D animation, I am undeterred by the challenges. I've chosen to create 3D animated characters to practice and enhance my skills. My goal is to apply these newfound abilities in my visual stories or for future collaborations with clients, companies, or studios.

## First Step – BUILDING THE SCENE

I started by creating movement for my character. As it was my first attempt, I opted to use pre-rigged animated movements of the human body. After some research, I incorporated this animation into **`Blender 3D software`**. Following that, I crafted the background scene and fashioned hair for my character using the particles section.

## Second Step – LIGHTING SETUP

Lighting plays a crucial role, and for this scene, I utilized a basic lighting setup, as depicted in the picture.

## Third Step – CAMERA MOVEMENT

I incorporated camera movement to enhance the cinematic experience. Additionally, I applied a **`Noise Function`** to the camera animation for a more realistic, fluid motion, avoiding a robotic feel.

## Fourth Step – MATERIALS

Once the entire animation was complete, I added materials to my character. In simpler terms, I infused our character with vibrant colors to bring both them and their surroundings to life.

## Fifth Step — COLOR GRADING

As evident in the comparison, the left picture exhibits significant differences from the right one. My vision included a darker background for the 3D character, creating a strong color contrast. I achieved this effect through color grading using **`DaVinci Resolve`** software.
