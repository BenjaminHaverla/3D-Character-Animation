# 3D Character Animation Workflow:
This 3D animation marks my initial attempt. As a beginner in the field of 3D animation, I am undeterred by the challenges. I've chosen to create 3D animated characters to practice and enhance my skills. My goal is to apply these newfound abilities in my visual stories or for future collaborations with clients, companies, or studios.
